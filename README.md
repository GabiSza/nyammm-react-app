# Project title

**Nyammm** refers to something yummy both in Hungarian and Catalan as well. I wanted to create a recipe app that can combine my love for both cuisines.
However, my plans got a bit blocked by the available data online. Therefore, my project is a basic recipe app with all kinds of cuisine but its name still has a touch of foreignness. ðŸ˜„ (This is an elegant way to say that I could not find any other title with my sleep deprived brain)

## Project description

Before starting to work on my project I created a Google survey and 27 respondents filled it in. Based on the results I got the confirmation that users would be happy to use a Catalan cuisine app and would actually need something to feel more integrated in Catalonia. Most of the respondents 63 % answered 'Yes' to the question whether this application would be necessary. Considering the fact that most of the respondents 51.9 % do not use any cooking app, this is a positive reaction. But now as I am doing a general recipe app I realized, that before asking my future users what they want, I should have checked first what I can do with the data available. ðŸ˜† Big lesson for the future.

Anyway, it was fun to create user stories, user personas and wireframe for this MVP and I thought that I can really do the app in a way I imagined. But none of the tested API contained specific Catalan food. Even if I could have done the categories based on the holidays, there was only one Catalan recipe in the Spoonacualar food API I used. I have tried other food APIs as well, many of them were not for free and/or did not contain categories/recipes I was interested in.
Instead of creating a global CSS file I used React styled components which was handy to know, especially until now we mainly used separate CSS files during our exercises. React started to feel like an amusement park with surprises instead of an endless trail into darkness.

I think with a back end part I could make an app I want, uploading specific recipes and images but for now I leave it only with front end.

As this app contains different cuisines I wanted to add some of my favorites: Greek and Mediterranean as well.
The homepage contains the Healthy picks and the Vegetarian dishes, these are my favorite ones so I wanted to highlight them as well.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Credit statement

This is a student project that was created at
[CodeOp](http://codeop.tech), a full stack development bootcamp in Barcelona.

I used the [Scrimba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) to learn more about React and other tutorials from youtube:

and for the [React icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
Also happy with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
And last but definitely not least I have spent quite some time with understanding [React Route](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_router.asp)
